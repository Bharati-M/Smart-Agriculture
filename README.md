# Smart-Agriculture
A computer vision system for detecting plant health issues and crop diseases in field images to enable early intervention and yield optimization.
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to detect plant leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
It aims to assist farmers and researchers by providing an automated, accurate, and cost-effective system to identify diseases from leaf images — reducing crop loss and improving yield quality.
